Built in Python 3.8, using [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) for data manipulation and [plotly](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py) for interactive visualization, renders in browser using [dash](https://github.com/plotly/dash) to output some HTML and React; CSS is added to dash externally.

Data is pulled from [DPC](https://github.com/pcm-dpc/COVID-19), which is doing a great job at data storing!

### Compile it yourself

1. Install all the [requirements](requirements.txt).

2. Change the province you want to visualize on line 120 in [main.py](main.py) and run the server locally (on port 8080).
