## covid19-italy
Map and charts data visualization of __Covid19__ cases in Italy. 

Built in Python 3.8, using [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) for data manipulation and [plotly](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py) for visualization, renders in browser using [dash](https://github.com/plotly/dash) to output some HTML, CSS and JS.

Data is pulled from [DPC](https://github.com/pcm-dpc/COVID-19), which is doing a great job at data storing!

The [script.py](script.py) requires an input from terminal of a province that you want to plot the graph of. Then it starts a local server and there you go!
